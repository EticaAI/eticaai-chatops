# Etica.AI ChatOps
> **Notice: please check the [ChatOps _for non-DevOps people_ Working Group 2018/01](https://github.com/fititnt/chatops-wg).**

Etica.AI ChatOps is a repository that contains code and a [forum (see issues in GitHub)](https://github.com/EticaAI/eticaai-chatops/issues)
to public document part of the process of how ChatOps is being implemented
within the Etica.AI organization.

We believe it is not enough _to scale_ infrastructure, we have "_to scale_
people", in the sense of making people more efficient and creative, and
delegating repetitive tasks to machines and thereby increasing their impact.

**We want to enable people's means aligned with the ideals of Etica.AI learn and
teach**. This means that we want to enable people's means aligned with the
ideals of Etica.AI learn and teach, even those who work with machines should
optimize their work for humans.

## What is ChatOps?
> ChatOps is a collaboration model that helps to connect
people, process, tools, and automation into a transparent workflow
(conversation-driven development). So it allows to automate tasks and
collaborate, encourages teams to be transparent, working better, cheaper and
faster. [See awesome-chatops](https://github.com/exAspArk/awesome-chatops).
